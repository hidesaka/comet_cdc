Wiring started on May 26th, but found error at tension measurements
on May 26th, so all wires stringed on 26th were re-measured on 27th.
COMETCDC.xml in top dir records lastest result of the mesuremnets,
so no entries on May 26th.
To consistent with top COMETCDC.xml, xml of May 26th is not used.
Or, read COMETCDC.xml at each days... => reading several xml fiels may slow...
